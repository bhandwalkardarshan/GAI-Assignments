# Node.js and MongoDB Server with User Signup and Welcome Mail Functionality

**Objective:** Develop a Node.js server using Express and MongoDB to handle user signup functionality. Upon successful signup, trigger a welcome email to the user.

**Features:**
- **Node.js Server Setup:** Set up a Node.js server using the Express framework to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **MongoDB Integration:** Integrate MongoDB as the database to store user information. Define a user model to structure and manage user data.
- **User Signup Route:** Create an API route to handle user signup. Implement validation for user input data, including email, password, etc. Hash and securely store user passwords in the MongoDB database.
- **Welcome Email:** Integrate an email service (e.g., Nodemailer) to send a welcome email to users upon successful signup. The welcome email should contain a personalized message and possibly important information or links.

**Technical Requirements:**

- **Node.js and Express:** Use Node.js and Express to set up the server and define API routes.
- **MongoDB:** Utilize MongoDB for data storage. Set up a connection to MongoDB from the Node.js server.
- **User Model:** Define a user model to structure the user data stored in the MongoDB database.
- **User Signup Route:** Implement an API route (e.g., /api/signup) to handle user signup requests. Validate user input and securely store user data in the MongoDB database.
- **Password Hashing:** Implement a secure password hashing mechanism to protect user passwords.
- **Welcome Email Functionality:** Use an email service library (e.g., Nodemailer) to send welcome emails to users. Include relevant user information and a personalized welcome message in the email.

**Getting Started:**

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js (version X.X.X)
- MongoDB
- Any other requirements

**Installation:**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd your-repo
    npm install

**Usage:**
Explain how to use your application. Include any configuration or setup that is necessary.
1. Environment Variables
    Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:

    ```bash
    MAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
    MAIL_PASSWORD=your-email-password
    DB_URI=mongodb://localhost/your-database-name
    PORT=3000

2. Running the Application
    Run the application using the following command:
    ```bash
    npm start

Your server will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 (or another port if specified).

**API Routes:**
Document your API routes and their functionality here.

/api/signup: User signup route.
Provide detailed information about the API routes, request/response formats, and any required parameters.
